# Code Review: core-todo

## Summary
- **Overall Status**: FAIL
- **Files Reviewed**: 17
- **Issues Found**: Critical: 1, High: 3, Medium: 8, Low: 5

## Automated Checks
- **Build**: ❌ FAILED - TypeScript compilation errors
- **Type Check**: ❌ FAILED - 122 type errors found
- **Linting**: ❌ FAILED - 3 errors, 4 warnings
- **Tests**: ❌ FAILED - Jest configuration issues, all tests failing

## Critical Issues

### 1. Non-functional Application (BLOCKER)
**Location**: `src/stores/todos/todo-store.ts:2-4`
```typescript
export const useTodoStore = () => {
  return {};
};
```
**Impact**: The entire todo store is a placeholder returning an empty object. All components expecting store methods fail with runtime errors. The application is completely non-functional.

**Required Actions**:
- Implement the complete Zustand store with all expected methods
- Follow the patterns defined in the test files
- Include proper TypeScript types

## High Priority Issues

### 1. Memory Leaks from Uncleared Timeouts
**Locations**:
- `src/components/todos/TodoItem.tsx:60`
- `src/components/todos/TodoFooter.tsx:19`

**Issue**: `setTimeout` calls without cleanup can cause memory leaks if components unmount during the timeout period.

**Fix**:
```typescript
useEffect(() => {
  const timer = setTimeout(() => setShowDeleteConfirm(false), 3000);
  return () => clearTimeout(timer);
}, [showDeleteConfirm]);
```

### 2. Type Safety Violations
**Multiple Locations**: All component files using `useTodoStore`

**Issue**: Components attempt to call methods on an empty object, causing TypeScript errors and runtime failures.

### 3. Test Infrastructure Broken
**Issue**: Jest is not properly configured for TypeScript/TSX files, causing all tests to fail.

**Required Actions**:
- Add proper Jest configuration
- Install required Babel presets
- Configure TypeScript support

## Medium Priority Issues

### 1. Missing Error Boundaries
No error boundaries exist to catch and handle component errors gracefully.

### 2. DRY Violations
- Confirmation timeout pattern repeated in multiple components
- Should extract to a `useConfirmation` hook

### 3. Potential Race Conditions
**Location**: `src/components/todos/TodoInput.tsx:23-27`
- Checks store error immediately after async operation

### 4. Silent Data Truncation
**Location**: `src/lib/validation/todo.ts:19`
- `sanitizeTodoText` truncates without user notification

### 5. Large Component Files
**Location**: `src/components/todos/TodoItem.tsx` (153 lines)
- Should be split into smaller sub-components

### 6. Missing Performance Optimizations
- No memoization for TodoItem components
- No virtualization for large lists
- Filtering happens on every render

### 7. Focus Management Issues
- Focus lost after deleting todos
- No focus trap in edit mode

### 8. Magic Numbers
- Hardcoded 3000ms timeouts should use named constants

## Low Priority Issues

### 1. Incomplete Accessibility
- Missing live region announcements for state changes
- No skip links for keyboard navigation

### 2. No Storage Quota Monitoring
- Could fail silently when localStorage is full

### 3. Missing URL State
- Filter state not reflected in URL

### 4. No Keyboard Shortcuts
- Spec mentions Ctrl+A, Ctrl+D shortcuts not implemented

### 5. ESLint Warnings
- Unused imports in test files
- `any` types in test assertions

## Security Concerns

### ✅ Good Security Practices
- Proper input validation with length constraints
- React's built-in XSS protection utilized
- No direct HTML rendering
- Sanitization in validation module

### ⚠️ Minor Security Considerations
1. **JSON Parsing**: While wrapped in try-catch, more specific error handling would be beneficial
2. **localStorage Reliability**: No handling for corrupted data or quota exceeded errors
3. **No CSP Headers**: Content Security Policy not configured (infrastructure concern)

## Code Quality Assessment

### Positive Observations
1. **Well-structured TypeScript types** with proper interfaces
2. **Good component organization** with feature-based folders
3. **Comprehensive accessibility attributes** (ARIA labels, roles)
4. **Proper separation of concerns** (validation, storage modules)
5. **Good test coverage structure** (once fixed)
6. **Consistent naming conventions**
7. **Mobile-first responsive design approach**

### Areas for Improvement
1. **Complete the implementation** - Core functionality missing
2. **Extract reusable patterns** - Confirmation dialogs, error handling
3. **Add proper documentation** - Component props, store methods
4. **Implement missing features** from specification
5. **Performance optimizations** for large datasets

## Architecture Review

### ✅ Strengths
- Clean separation between components, stores, and utilities
- Feature-based folder structure aids maintainability
- Type-safe approach with TypeScript
- Proper abstraction of storage logic

### ⚠️ Concerns
1. **Missing Store Implementation**: Critical architectural component absent
2. **No Service Layer**: Direct localStorage access could be abstracted
3. **No Error Recovery**: Need retry mechanisms and graceful degradation
4. **Missing State Management**: No loading states, optimistic updates

## Recommendations

### Immediate Actions (P0)
1. **Implement the Zustand store** following test specifications
2. **Fix TypeScript compilation errors**
3. **Add cleanup for timeouts** to prevent memory leaks
4. **Configure Jest properly** for testing

### Short-term Improvements (P1)
1. Extract confirmation dialog logic to reusable hook
2. Add error boundaries for graceful error handling
3. Implement proper focus management
4. Add loading and error states
5. Fix all TypeScript type errors

### Long-term Enhancements (P2)
1. Split large components into smaller, focused components
2. Add React.memo for performance optimization
3. Implement keyboard shortcuts per specification
4. Add storage quota monitoring and handling
5. Implement data export/import functionality

## Conclusion

The core-todo feature shows a solid architectural foundation with good TypeScript typing, proper component structure, and accessibility considerations. However, the missing store implementation renders the application completely non-functional. This is a **CRITICAL BLOCKER** that must be addressed before any other improvements.

Once the store is implemented, the codebase demonstrates good practices and patterns that align well with modern React development. The component structure is clean, and the separation of concerns is well-maintained. With the identified issues addressed, this could become a robust and maintainable todo application.

**Recommendation**: Do not proceed to production until the critical store implementation is complete and all high-priority issues are resolved. The current state would result in a non-functional application.
