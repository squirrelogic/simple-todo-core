# TodoItem Component Migration Guide

## Overview

The TodoItem component has been decomposed into smaller, more focused components following the Single Responsibility Principle. This refactoring improves maintainability, testability, and reusability.

## Changes Made

### 1. Component Decomposition

The monolithic TodoItem component has been split into:

- **TodoCheckbox**: Handles the completion checkbox
- **TodoText**: Manages text display and editing
- **TodoActions**: Contains edit and delete buttons

### 2. Logic Extraction

Business logic has been extracted into custom hooks:

- **useTodoEdit**: Manages editing state and operations
- **useKeyboardNavigation**: Handles keyboard shortcuts

### 3. File Structure

```
Before:
- TodoItem.tsx (163 lines)

After:
- TodoItem.tsx (95 lines)
- TodoCheckbox.tsx (23 lines)
- TodoText.tsx (92 lines)
- TodoActions.tsx (42 lines)
- hooks/todos/useTodoEdit.ts (58 lines)
- hooks/todos/useKeyboardNavigation.ts (41 lines)
```

## Benefits

1. **Better Testability**: Each component can be tested in isolation
2. **Improved Reusability**: Components can be used in other contexts
3. **Easier Maintenance**: Smaller, focused components are easier to understand
4. **Performance**: Components are memoized for better performance

## Usage

The public API remains the same:

```tsx
<TodoItem todo={todo} onFocus={handleFocus} />
```

## Alternative: Compound Component Pattern

A compound component version is also available in `Todo.tsx`:

```tsx
import { Todo } from './Todo';

// Usage
<Todo.Container todo={todo} value={contextValue}>
  <Todo.Checkbox />
  <Todo.Text />
  <Todo.Actions />
</Todo.Container>
```

This pattern provides more flexibility in component composition and layout.

## Migration Steps

1. **No changes required** for existing usage
2. If customization is needed, consider using the compound component pattern
3. For new features, use the individual components directly

## Testing

All existing tests pass without modification. New components have their own test suites:

- `TodoCheckbox.test.tsx`
- `TodoText.test.tsx`
- `TodoActions.test.tsx`
- `useTodoEdit.test.ts`

## Performance Considerations

- TodoItem is wrapped with `React.memo` for performance
- Edit state is managed locally to prevent unnecessary re-renders
- Keyboard navigation is optimized with `useCallback`
