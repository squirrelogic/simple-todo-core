# Story: Multi-Device Notification Sync

**ID**: notifications-021
**Status**: Draft
**Priority**: Low
**Points**: 3

## User Story
As a user with multiple devices
I want notification states to sync across all my devices
So that I don't see the same notification multiple times

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Read status syncs across devices
- [ ] Dismissed notifications disappear everywhere
- [ ] Snooze state syncs to all devices
- [ ] Device-specific preferences supported
- [ ] Near real-time synchronization
- [ ] Handle offline device scenarios
- [ ] Conflict resolution for simultaneous actions
- [ ] Device management in settings

## Technical Notes
- Use event sourcing for state changes
- Implement CRDT for conflict resolution
- WebSocket for real-time sync
- Handle race conditions
- Consider eventual consistency
- Device fingerprinting for identification

## Dependencies
- Depends on: NOT-004 (Mobile push), NOT-019 (Real-time)
- Blocks: None

## Tasks
- [ ] Design sync architecture
- [ ] Implement device registry
- [ ] Create sync protocol
- [ ] Handle state conflicts
- [ ] Add device management UI
- [ ] Test multi-device scenarios
- [ ] Optimize sync performance
- [ ] Document sync behavior
