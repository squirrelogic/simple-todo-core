# Story: Notification Rate Limiting

**ID**: notifications-018
**Status**: Draft
**Priority**: Low
**Points**: 2

## User Story
As a system administrator
I want to implement rate limiting for notifications
So that users don't get spammed and systems remain stable

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Global rate limits per user per hour/day
- [ ] Channel-specific rate limits
- [ ] Category-based rate limiting
- [ ] Configurable rate limit thresholds
- [ ] Priority notifications bypass limits
- [ ] Rate limit notifications to admins
- [ ] Graceful handling when limits reached
- [ ] Rate limit metrics and monitoring

## Technical Notes
- Use Redis for rate limit counters
- Implement sliding window algorithm
- Different limits for different tiers
- Handle burst traffic gracefully
- Monitor rate limit violations
- Consider token bucket algorithm

## Dependencies
- Depends on: Core notification system
- Blocks: None

## Tasks
- [ ] Design rate limiting strategy
- [ ] Implement Redis counters
- [ ] Create rate limit middleware
- [ ] Add configuration system
- [ ] Handle limit exceeded cases
- [ ] Create monitoring alerts
- [ ] Test under load
- [ ] Document rate limits
- [ ] Add admin controls
