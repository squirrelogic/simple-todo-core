# Story: Todo Migration Execution

**ID**: user-auth-012
**Status**: Draft
**Priority**: High
**Points**: 5

## User Story
As a user who chose to migrate todos
I want my localStorage todos transferred to my account
So that I can access them from any device

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Migration starts immediately after confirmation
- [ ] Progress bar shows migration status
- [ ] Current todo being migrated displayed
- [ ] Pause/resume option for large migrations
- [ ] Error handling for individual todo failures
- [ ] Success count and failure count shown
- [ ] Rollback option if migration fails
- [ ] localStorage cleared after success
- [ ] Migrated todos appear in main list
- [ ] Original timestamps preserved
- [ ] Completion status maintained
- [ ] Success notification with todo count

## Technical Notes
- Create migration API endpoint with auth
- Process todos in batches (50 at a time)
- Add userId to each todo record
- Preserve all todo properties
- Use database transaction for atomicity
- Track migration progress in database
- Implement client-side progress polling
- Store rollback data temporarily
- Clear localStorage only after confirmation
- Handle duplicate IDs with new generation
- Log migration metrics and errors
- Send completion email notification
