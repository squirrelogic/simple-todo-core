# Story: Authentication Rate Limiting

**ID**: user-auth-019
**Status**: Draft
**Priority**: High
**Points**: 3

## User Story
As a system administrator
I want rate limiting on authentication endpoints
So that the system is protected from brute force attacks

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Login attempts limited to 5 per 15 minutes per IP
- [ ] Email-based limit of 10 attempts per hour
- [ ] Registration limited to 3 per hour per IP
- [ ] Password reset limited to 3 per hour per email
- [ ] Clear error message when limit reached
- [ ] Retry-after header in responses
- [ ] Exponential backoff for repeated violations
- [ ] Whitelist for trusted IPs (admin)
- [ ] Rate limit bypass for 2FA
- [ ] Monitoring dashboard for limits
- [ ] Auto-blocking for severe violations
- [ ] Redis-based distributed limiting

## Technical Notes
- Use express-rate-limit with Redis store
- Implement multiple limit strategies
- Track by IP and email separately
- Use sliding window algorithm
- Set proper HTTP headers (429 status)
- Configure exponential backoff
- Create admin whitelist system
- Monitor rate limit hits
- Alert on suspicious patterns
- Document limit thresholds
- Allow configuration via env vars

## Dependencies
- Depends on: user-auth-001, user-auth-003
- Blocks: None (security layer)

## Tasks
- [ ] Install rate limiting libraries
- [ ] Configure Redis for storage
- [ ] Implement IP-based limiting
- [ ] Add email-based limiting
- [ ] Create limit strategies per endpoint
- [ ] Add proper error responses
- [ ] Implement exponential backoff
- [ ] Create IP whitelist system
- [ ] Add monitoring metrics
- [ ] Configure alerting rules
- [ ] Write unit tests for limits
- [ ] Load test rate limiting
- [ ] Document configuration
