# Story: Large List Performance

**ID**: core-todo-012
**Status**: Draft
**Priority**: Medium
**Points**: 5

## User Story
As a power user with many todos
I want the app to remain fast with hundreds of items
So that I can manage large task lists efficiently

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] List renders 1000 todos in under 100ms
- [ ] Scrolling remains smooth (60fps)
- [ ] Todo operations complete in under 50ms
- [ ] Memory usage stays below 50MB
- [ ] No UI freezing during bulk operations
- [ ] Filter switching is instantaneous
- [ ] Search/filter performance is optimized
- [ ] Initial load time remains under 1 second
- [ ] Virtual scrolling for lists over 100 items

## Technical Notes
- Implement virtual scrolling with react-window
- Use React.memo for TodoItem optimization
- Implement efficient filter algorithms
- Use requestAnimationFrame for animations
- Batch DOM updates where possible
- Consider Web Workers for heavy operations
- Profile and optimize re-renders
- Implement lazy loading strategies
- Use performance monitoring

## Dependencies
- Depends on: core-todo-002
- Blocks: None

## Tasks
- [ ] Add react-window for virtual scrolling
- [ ] Implement TodoItem memoization
- [ ] Optimize filter/search algorithms
- [ ] Add performance monitoring
- [ ] Profile component renders
- [ ] Implement batch update logic
- [ ] Test with 1000+ todos
- [ ] Write performance benchmarks
- [ ] Document optimization strategies
- [ ] Create performance dashboard
