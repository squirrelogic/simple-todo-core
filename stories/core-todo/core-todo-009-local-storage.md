# Story: Local Storage Persistence

**ID**: core-todo-009
**Status**: Draft
**Priority**: High
**Points**: 3

## User Story
As a user
I want my todos to persist between browser sessions
So that I don't lose my task list when I close the browser

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] All todos are saved to localStorage automatically
- [ ] Todos are loaded on application startup
- [ ] Changes are saved immediately (no save button)
- [ ] Data persists across browser refreshes
- [ ] Data persists when closing and reopening browser
- [ ] Storage errors are handled gracefully
- [ ] Warning shown when approaching storage limit (80%)
- [ ] Data format is versioned for future migrations
- [ ] Corrupted data doesn't crash the app

## Technical Notes
- Use Zustand's persist middleware for automatic localStorage sync
- Configure persist with 'todo-storage' name key
- Implement partialize to save only todos and filter state
- Create persistence effect for storage monitoring
- Add migration effect for schema upgrades
- Implement storage quota checking in effects layer
- Add data validation in migration effect
- Zustand handles serialization automatically
- Plan for future IndexedDB migration

## Dependencies
- Depends on: core-todo-001
- Blocks: core-todo-016, core-todo-018

## Tasks
- [ ] Configure Zustand persist middleware in store
- [ ] Define TodoData schema interface
- [ ] Create persistence effect module
- [ ] Implement storage monitoring in effects
- [ ] Add error handling for quota exceeded
- [ ] Create migration effect with validation
- [ ] Add storage usage monitoring
- [ ] Implement version field for migrations
- [ ] Write unit tests for persistence effect
- [ ] Write integration test for store persistence
- [ ] Test with storage quota limits
