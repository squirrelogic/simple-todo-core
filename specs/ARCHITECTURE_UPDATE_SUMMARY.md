# Architecture Update Summary

## Overview
All three feature specifications have been updated to align with the new architecture using Zustand and the feature-first pattern. The updates ensure consistency with the core-todo specification changes.

## Key Changes Applied

### 1. Feature-First Structure
All specifications now follow the feature-first directory structure:
```
src/features/{feature-name}/
├── components/     # UI components
├── stores/         # Zustand stores
├── hooks/          # Custom hooks
├── effects/        # Side effects
├── types/          # TypeScript types
└── utils/          # Helper functions
```

### 2. Zustand State Management
- Replaced React Context references with Zustand stores
- Added dedicated store definitions for each feature domain
- Implemented proper store composition and persistence where needed
- Used Zustand middleware (persist, subscribeWithSelector) appropriately

### 3. Updated Code Examples

#### Due Dates Feature
- Added `useDueDateStore` for date filtering and sorting
- Added `useReminderStore` for notification preferences
- Added `useDueDatePreferences` for user settings
- Custom hooks: `useDueDates`, `useReminders`

#### Notifications Feature
- Added `useNotificationStore` for notification state
- Added `usePreferenceStore` for user preferences
- Added channel-specific stores for different notification types
- Custom hooks: `useNotifications`, `useNotificationPermission`

#### User Auth Feature
- Added `useAuthStore` for authentication state
- Added `useSessionStore` for session management
- Added `useProfileStore` for user profile data
- Custom hooks: `useAuth`, `useMigration`

### 4. Testing Structure
All test files now follow the feature-first pattern:
```
src/features/{feature-name}/__tests__/
├── components/
├── stores/
├── hooks/
├── utils/
└── integration/
```

### 5. Type Definitions
- Types are now co-located within each feature
- Clear separation between feature-specific types and shared types
- Proper type imports from other features when needed

## Integration Points

### Cross-Feature Dependencies
1. **Due Dates → Core Todo**: Extends Todo type with date properties
2. **Notifications → Due Dates**: Uses due date information for reminders
3. **User Auth → Core Todo**: Adds user ownership to todos
4. **All Features → Core Todo Store**: Integration through the main todo store

### Store Composition
- Each feature maintains its own stores for feature-specific state
- Core todo store is extended/enhanced by features as needed
- Stores can subscribe to changes in other stores using Zustand's subscribeWithSelector

## Benefits of This Architecture

1. **Better Organization**: Each feature is self-contained with all related code in one place
2. **Easier Testing**: Co-located tests with clear boundaries
3. **Improved Developer Experience**: Clear where to find and add code
4. **Better Performance**: Zustand's shallow equality checks and selective subscriptions
5. **Type Safety**: Strong TypeScript support throughout
6. **Scalability**: Easy to add new features without affecting existing ones

## Migration Notes

When implementing these changes:
1. Start with the core-todo feature as the foundation
2. Implement features incrementally
3. Use the existing localStorage data for initial state
4. Ensure proper cleanup of old Context providers
5. Update imports throughout the application
