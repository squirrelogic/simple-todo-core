6. **Notifications**: Basic browser notifications

### Nice-to-Have
1. **Natural Language**: "next Friday", "in 3 days"
2. **Recurring Tasks**: Daily, weekly, monthly
3. **Time Selection**: Specific times, not just dates
4. **Bulk Operations**: Multi-select date changes
5. **Advanced Filters**: Custom date ranges
6. **Snooze**: Postpone notifications

## Next Steps

1. **Immediate Actions**:
   - Review specification with stakeholders
   - Finalize UI/UX designs

## Important Notes

- Timezone handling is critical - test thoroughly across DST transitions
- Notification permissions require careful UX to maximize opt-in
- Mobile experience needs special attention for date input
- Performance with many dated todos must be validated
- Natural language parsing should fail gracefully

## Dependencies on Other Features

- **core-todo**: Must be fully implemented
- **user-auth**: Date preferences tied to user accounts (future)
- Consider how dates interact with future features (categories, projects)
